Challenge Project using OOP 

This project was built using Code Academy giving a simple template of what was of me to build a pokemon game

- I added type advantages 
- I gave charmander a speical flame thrower (line: 172) 
- Made a dictionary to keep track of eveloutions 
- Eventually going to add a speed atrribute to see who will attack first during battle.
